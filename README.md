- Interest in foraging and gardening on the whole has been on the uptick in recent years. To match the influx of learners, Plant It has been created. Plant It is designed to be an easy and interactive way to post about your local plantlife, as well as see and comment on posts from other users! It is not location based, so any user may see a post from potentially anywhere if they click into the plant file itself. Our page design is structured so that posts are clear and separated appropriately.

## User Story:
